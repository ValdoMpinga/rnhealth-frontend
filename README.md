# Indoor Radon Forecasting Web Application

This web application, built using React, allows users to visualize indoor radon concentration forecasts generated by LSTM models. The application consumes an API that provides access to the LSTM models, which are used to make accurate radon concentration predictions. The forecasts are displayed using interactive charts, showing the progression of radon levels over time, along with forecasted values. Additionally, the application includes a line range chart that visualizes the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to provide insights into the accuracy of the forecasts.

# Features

- A landing page providing an overview of the application.
- Sensor tabs that navigate to dedicated pages for making radon concentration forecasts.
- Fetches radon concentration forecasts from the API powered by LSTM models.
- Displays a line chart showcasing the progression of radon levels over time, including forecasted values.
- Includes a line range chart that visualizes the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to provide an understanding of the forecast accuracy.
- Offers an interactive user interface to navigate and explore the radon concentration data.
